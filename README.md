# Candidate Search

## Description

This project is a Candidate Search Application that leverages the GitHub API to fetch and display profiles as potential hiring candidates. The purpose of this application is to serve as a mock hiring platform, showcasing my programming skills in TypeScript and React. It's a fantastic way to demonstrate the practical integration of APIs, and I highly encourage others to build a similar project to practice and enhance their coding skills with TypeScript and React.
